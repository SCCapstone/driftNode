The fixWifi.bash script will take a bag file and take its wifi data and convert it into a usable form so that it can be plotted.

The format to run the script is:

./fixWifi.bash input.bag "nodeName" "nodeName2"

input.bag - This is the name of the bag you want to fix
nodeName - This is the name of the node that created the bag
nodeName2 - This is the name of the node that the wifi data was looking at

for example if dn3 created the bag and over wifi it saw dn3 you will run:

./fixWifi.bash input.bag "dn3" "dn1"

This will add to the bag a topic called /dn1Signal which is the signal strength from dn3 to dn1
